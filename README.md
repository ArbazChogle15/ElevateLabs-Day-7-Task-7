Task 7 — Basic Sales Summary Using SQLite & Python
This project demonstrates how to create a simple sales summary using SQLite, Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.It includes building a small database, inserting sample sales data, running summary operations, and generating charts.

📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to:
•	Create a small SQLite database (sales_data.db)
•	Insert basic sales information into a table
•	Retrieve and summarize the sales data using Python
•	Display results in the console
•	Generate bar charts to visualize sales performance

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
•	Python
•	SQLite (sqlite3)
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
These tools help in creating a database, performing analysis, and visualizing the results.

📂 Project Workflow
1. Database Creation
A new SQLite database file (sales_data.db) is created.Inside it, a sales table is defined with columns for:
•	Product name
•	Quantity sold
•	Price
2. Insert Sample Data
Sample sales entries are added to the table.Each record includes:
•	A product
•	The quantity sold
•	The price per unit
3. Data Analysis in Python
Using Python:
•	The database is connected
•	Data is fetched into Pandas DataFrames
•	Summary values are computed, such as:
o	Total quantity sold per product
o	Total revenue per product
o	Average price of each product
o	Total items sold overall
4. Displaying Results
The calculated summaries are printed using simple print() statements.
5. Visualizing the Data
Two bar charts are created using Matplotlib:
1.	Revenue by Product
2.	Total Quantity Sold by Product
Each chart is saved as an image file for easy reference.

🚀 Skills Practiced
•	Working with SQLite databases
•	Executing Python-based data analysis
•	Loading SQL query results into Pandas
•	Creating and saving bar charts
•	Understanding basic revenue and sales metrics

✔️ Task Status: Completed
This task builds a strong foundation in database handling, SQL-Python integration, and visualization — ideal for beginners exploring data analytics.
